            <p> I absolutely love creating new things and diving into creative areas 
			because it feels like a boundless adventure where my imagination can truly
			soar. Whether I'm crafting a new project, experimenting with different mediums, 
			or brainstorming innovative ideas, I find immense joy in the process of bringing
			something fresh and unique into existence. The thrill of exploring uncharted creative 
			territories excites me, as each new endeavor is a chance to push boundaries and discover
			hidden talents. This passion not only fuels my enthusiasm but also drives me to constantly seek
			out new challenges and experiences
			that inspire and enrich my creative journey.</p>

		       <li><span>TRAVELING</span><br>I enjoy travelling because it’s like opening a new book with every destination
			   I visit. Each journey is a thrilling opportunity to immerse myself in different cultures, 
			   taste new cuisines, and explore breathtaking landscapes. 
			   The excitement of navigating unfamiliar places and meeting 
			   diverse people never gets old. Traveling ignites
			   my curiosity and broadens my perspective, allowing m
			   e to experience the world in ways that deeply enrich 
			   my life. Every trip is an adventure with unforgettable memories, 
			   and I cherish the way it continuously fuels my sense

			   in life, not only has my relationship with God better me as a person, but most importantly
			   it sets the standard of how i try to treat people. The Holy Bible speaks about respecting those who
